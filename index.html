  <ol class="get">
    <li>Choose the habits you want to track. Start with a few that are important to you.</li>
    <li>Decide how you will track your habits. You can use a simple checklist, a calendar, or this app right here.</li>
    <li>Set a specific goal for each habit. For example, "Exercise for 30 minutes every day" or "Read for 20 minutes before bed."</li>
    <li>Start tracking your habits daily. Be consistent and try to do it at the same time each day.</li>
    <li>Review your progress regularly. At the end of each week or month, look back at your tracker and see how well you did.</li>
